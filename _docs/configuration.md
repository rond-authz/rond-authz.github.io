# Rönd configuration

To correctly setup the container, you need to provide a few configurations. Some configurations are provided as environment variables, while others are provided via configuration files.

## Environment variables

## Configuration files

Rönd accepts two configuration files, one containing the OpenPolicy Agent Rego policies (required) and an optional file for OpenAPI Specification details.

### OpenPolicy Agent policies

The `.rego` file must be provided inside the directory specified with the `OPA_MODULES_DIRECTORY` environment variable. Right now is supported only a single file, so the first `.rego` file found will be used for policy evaluation. Any other `.rego` file will be ignored.

### OpenAPI Specification file

The OpenAPI Specification file is required only when the `TARGET_SERVICE_OAS_PATH` variable is not provided. This file specifies the API that are exposed by your service, and thus must be authorized with specific policies.

#### Specify API permissions

In order to define the Rego policies to be evaluated for the API to be authorized, you must define the custom attribute `x-rond` in your OAS schema.

The `x-rond` attribute is shaped as an object with the following properties:

- `allow` **(string, required)**: The name of the Rego policy that should be executed upon the API invocation;
- `options` **(object)**:
  - `enableResourcePermissionsMapOptimization` **(boolean)**: Flag to enable the generation of an optimized map of user permissions (useful when performing RBAC logics). More information available in the [Policy Integration page](policy-integration);
- `resourceFilter` **(object)**: Object representing information on what resource the API is looking for to perform filtering operations:
  - `rowFilter` **(object)**: This object contains all the configurations needed to perform filtering operation on rows:
    - `enabled` **(bool)**: Activation value for row filtering;
    - `headerKey` **(string)**: Identifier of the header sent to the requested service in which the interpolated query will be injected. The default values is `acl_rows`;
- `responseFilter` **(object)**: This object contains all the configurations needed to perform filtering operation on response:
  - `policy`: The name of the Rego policy that should be executed upon the API invocation.

{%
  include alert.html
  type="warning"
  content="Please note that any API that is not specified is immediately blocked."
%}

For example, if you want the `greetings_read` policy to be evaluated when invoking the `GET /hello` API, your custom service must define its API documentation as follows:

```json
{
    "paths": {
        "/hello": {
            "get": {
                "x-rond": {
                    "allow": "greetings_read"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you want to generate a query, you can enable the `resourceFilter` option.
With this option you can enable query generation, which will change the way the `allow` policy is treated. 
This allows you to write a policy that returns a query that is then forwarded to the application service using the header specified with the `headerKey` option.  
For more details check the [Rows Filtering guide](/docs/policy-integration#rows-filtering).

```json
{
    "paths": {
        "/hello": {
            "get": {
                "x-rond": {
                    "allow": "greetings_read",
                    "resourceFilter": {
                        "rowFilter": {
                          "enabled": true,
                          "headerKey": "x-acl-rows"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you need to modify the response payload you can add the `responseFilter`field. 
With the configuration shown below, the `greetings_read` policy will be evaluated before contacting the application service.
When the application service sends its response, the `filter_response_example` policy will be evaluated and its result will be used as the new response body.

```json
{
    "paths": {
        "/hello": {
            "get": {
                "x-rond": {
                    "allow": "greetings_read",
                    "responseFilter": {
                      "policy": "filter_response_example"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```


> Any API invocation to the path matching the one provided as `TARGET_SERVICE_OAS_PATH` with method `GET` will always be proxied to the target service, unless the given OpenAPI Specification provides the path with a custom policy configuration. In this case, the API will be proxied only if the policy evaluates successfully.

## Standalone mode

Rönd can run in standalone mode. To enable this mode, just set the `STANDALONE` environment variable to `true`. 

When the standalone mode is active, Rönd will expose the APIs defined in the provided OAS under the `PATH_PREFIX_STANDALONE` environment variable.
