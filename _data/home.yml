  - title: <strong>A shield that protects and authorizes</strong>
    subtitle: Rönd is an open source authorization mechanism that defines the concepts of Roles, Permissions, and User Groups as building blocks.</br/></br/>These building blocks allow you to create both an attribute-based access control (ABAC) and a role-based access control (RBAC) model. The system will be a true mirror of your organization and it will reflect the actual role people have and the specific actions they must perform.<br/><br/>Rönd acts like a true shield that enables you to improve data security while providing full independence and 360-degree permission governance.

  - title: <strong>A fully-equipped Viking warrior infrastructure</strong>
    subtitle: Rönd wears armor made with the best technology on the market. Built on top of the OPA policy, it uses Rego language to write policy applied to APIs' calls.<br/><br/>It relies on the Sidecar Container Pattern to avoid a single point of failure. This means that each pod has an extra container pattern in charge of implementing the authorization controls. The sidecar container intercepts all the incoming requests and proxies them to the actual microservice only if authorization controls are successfully passed.<br/><br/>Rönd simplifies security management with centralized policies executed in a distributed system. Forget endless lines of code, and focus only on the authorization rules.
